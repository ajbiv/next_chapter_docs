# Documentation Project

A living documentation project designed for collaborative AI-assisted planning, specifications, and business analysis.

## Overview

This documentation project is structured to work seamlessly with Obsidian while maintaining proper version control through Git. It serves as a central hub for:

- Strategic planning and roadmaps
- Technical specifications and requirements
- Business analysis and processes
- Meeting notes and decisions
- Templates and workflows

## Getting Started

1. **Clone or Initialize**: This project is version controlled with Git
2. **Obsidian Integration**: Add this folder to your Obsidian vault
3. **Start Documenting**: Use the templates in `05-templates/` to create new documents
4. **Collaborate with AI**: Use this as your workspace for AI-assisted planning and analysis

## Best Practices

- Use descriptive filenames with dates when relevant (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- Link related documents using Obsidian's `[[wikilink]]` syntax
- Tag documents appropriately for easy discovery
- Keep the archive folder clean by moving completed work there
- Commit changes regularly to maintain version history

## Obsidian Features

This project is optimized for Obsidian's features:
- **Graph View**: Visualize connections between documents
- **Tags**: Organize content with `#tags`
- **Links**: Connect related concepts with `[[links]]`
- **Templates**: Use template files for consistency
- **Daily Notes**: Track progress and decisions over time

## Contributing

When working with AI assistants:
1. Create clear, descriptive document titles
2. Use consistent formatting and structure
3. Link related concepts and documents
4. Update the project regularly
5. Archive completed work to keep the active workspace clean
