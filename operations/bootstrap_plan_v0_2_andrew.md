# Bootstrap Plan v0.2 — Integrating the Andrew Pilot + Business Readiness

**Date:** 2025-12-13 (America/New_York)  
**Primary objective:** Build a small, real, repeatable AI-automation offer by shipping a *micro-pilot* for Andrew (general contractor), turning it into a case study, then using it to win 1–2 additional pilots while you prepare financially and operationally to leave employment.

---

## North Star Outcomes (90 days)

1. **1 working pilot in production** for Andrew that saves measurable time (or removes a recurring pain).
2. **1 polished case study** (anonymized if needed): Problem → Workflow → Solution → Results.
3. **A repeatable offer** you can sell: “Workflow Audit + 1 Automation Pilot.”
4. **Business readiness basics**: name, entity/taxes plan, insurance/banking, runway plan, and “unemployment transition checklist.”

---

## Guiding Principles

- **Start with one workflow.** Don’t boil the ocean.
- **Draft mode first.** Automate creation of drafts/digests before auto-sending anything.
- **Auditable by default.** Every automation writes back to a tracker/log.
- **Sell fixed scope, not hours.** You’re reducing risk for both of you while you build skill.

## Track A — Andrew Pilot (Primary)

### Why Andrew is your best first pilot
- Clear ROI: permits + follow-ups + doc filing are time sinks.
- Repeatable: the workflow exists for every job.
- Low-risk automation options: email drafts, trackers, Dropbox filing.

### Pilot Options (choose ONE first)
**Option 1: Permit Follow-Up Copilot (highest ROI)**
- A simple tracker (Airtable / Google Sheet / Notion)
- Intake: project + subs list + target dates
- Auto-nudges to subs (email/text) + status capture
- Daily digest to Andrew: who’s late, who replied, what’s blocked
- Escalation rule: “no response after N nudges”

**Option 2: Email → Dropbox Auto-Filing (fast win)**
- Watch an email label/folder (e.g., “Permits” / “Proposals”)
- Extract project identity + doc type
- Rename consistently and file into Dropbox project folders
- Optional reply: “Saved, here’s the link”

**Success metrics (keep simple)**
- Andrew follow-up time reduced (self-reported + sample week)
- Fewer late permit submissions / fewer missed follow-ups
- Filing accuracy rate (e.g., >95% correct folder/naming after tuning)

## 30-Day Plan (Weeks 1–4)

### Week 1 — Reconnect + Workflow Walkthrough
**Goal:** Get one real workflow on the calendar and captured.

- [ ] Send Andrew follow-up text to schedule a 30–45 min screenshare walkthrough.
- [ ] On the call, capture:
  - Trigger: what starts the cycle?
  - Actors: which subs and how he contacts them
  - Artifacts: what “submitted” looks like (PDF receipt, email confirmation, etc.)
  - Current pain: where the time goes (follow-ups, missing info, doc chaos)
- [ ] Output: **1-page Current Workflow Map** (bullets are fine).

**Call script (4 questions)**
1) “Walk me through the last permit cycle—start to finish.”  
2) “What does ‘done’ look like for each sub?”  
3) “Where do docs live today and what’s annoying?”  
4) “If I could remove *one* repetitive task this month, what would it be?”

---

### Week 2 — Discovery Sprint (Fixed Scope) + Pilot Proposal
**Goal:** Reduce uncertainty and lock a small, safe scope.

- [ ] Deliver a **Discovery Sprint** doc:
  - Top 3 opportunities ranked by ROI
  - Recommended *one* pilot (Option 1 or 2)
  - Tool stack choice + rough run costs
  - Success metrics + “definition of done”
  - Risks/assumptions (access, data quality, sub responsiveness)
- [ ] Offer **fixed-price** discovery (or “credit discovery fee toward pilot”).

**Artifacts**
- [ ] “Pilot Proposal” (1 page)
- [ ] “Implementation Plan” (simple checklist)
- [ ] “Draft Mode” safety statement (Andrew approves during phase 1)

---

### Week 3 — Build Micro-Pilot (Draft Mode)
**Goal:** A working v1 that touches real inputs and produces real outputs.

- [ ] Set up:
  - Email label/folder and/or forwarding address
  - Dropbox pilot folder
  - Tracker (Sheet/Airtable) schema
- [ ] Build the automation:
  - Intake → classify/extract → write draft/digest → log
- [ ] Run with one live job (or one controlled test job).

---

### Week 4 — Run, Tune, and Measure
**Goal:** Prove value and capture a case study.

- [ ] Tune extraction rules / templates
- [ ] Measure:
  - time saved estimate
  - reduction in follow-up burden
  - error rate (misfiled docs, wrong project)
- [ ] Ask Andrew for a short testimonial (even a text quote).

---

## 60–90 Day Plan

### Month 2 — Productize the Offer + Build Portfolio Around Andrew
**Goal:** Turn the pilot into something you can sell again.

- [ ] Convert Andrew work into **Portfolio Case Study #1**
  - Before/After workflow
  - Short Loom demo (2–3 min)
  - Screenshots (tracker + digest example)
- [ ] Create reusable templates:
  - Tracker schema (generic)
  - Email follow-up templates
  - Folder naming conventions
  - Implementation checklist
- [ ] Define your repeatable service:
  - **“Workflow Audit + 1 Automation Pilot (2 weeks)”**
  - Optional ongoing support retainer

### Month 3 — Outreach Using Proof
**Goal:** Use the Andrew story to win 1–2 more pilots.

- [ ] Reach out to 10 targets (neighbors, local business owners, referrals)
- [ ] Script: “I built X for a GC; want to see if it applies to your workflow?”
- [ ] Run 1–2 more micro-pilots (same template, new domain).

---

## Track B — Business Setup + “Preparing to Not Be Employed” (Parallel)

### Week 1–2 — Identity + Admin Setup
- [ ] **Pick a business name** (shortlist 5; check domain availability).
- [ ] Decide: **brand** (public-facing) vs **legal entity name** (can differ).
- [ ] Set up basics:
  - [ ] domain + simple landing page (services + contact)
  - [ ] dedicated email (e.g., hello@…)
  - [ ] LinkedIn positioning update (clear offer + “pilot” framing)

### Week 2–4 — Taxes, Entity, and Money Hygiene
*(Not legal/tax advice — best to confirm with a CPA.)*

- [ ] Choose entity approach:
  - Sole prop now vs LLC now (common path: LLC + separate bank account)
- [ ] Find a CPA (or consult) for:
  - estimated quarterly taxes plan
  - how to track expenses/income
  - S-Corp timing (if/when income supports it)
- [ ] Set up:
  - [ ] business checking account
  - [ ] bookkeeping tool (QuickBooks/Wave) or a clean spreadsheet
  - [ ] expense tracking + receipt capture workflow
- [ ] Write your **pricing model** (starter):
  - Discovery Sprint (fixed)
  - Pilot build (fixed)
  - Ongoing support (monthly)

### Insurance + Contracts (Minimum Viable Safety)
- [ ] Consider basic coverage (general liability / professional liability) depending on scope.
- [ ] Create lightweight agreements:
  - [ ] Discovery Sprint agreement
  - [ ] Pilot statement of work (SOW)
  - [ ] Data/privacy notes (especially if client data is sensitive)

### “Not Being Employed” Checklist (Start Now)
- [ ] **Runway calculation**
  - monthly burn
  - minimum runway target (e.g., 9–12 months)
  - what can be cut/paused
- [ ] Benefits planning
  - health insurance options (COBRA, marketplace, spouse plan)
  - life/disability insurance review
- [ ] Retirement plan decisions
  - options for rolling 401(k) if needed
  - consider Solo 401(k) later (when revenue supports)
- [ ] Set an “exit criteria” gate:
  - revenue target OR signed pipeline + runway
  - number of paying clients
  - repeatable offer proven

---

## Track C — Skills Ramp (Only What the Pilot Requires)

**Rule:** Learn tools only to ship the Andrew pilot.

- [ ] Pick one automation stack for v1 (example options):
  - Low-code: Zapier/Make + Google Workspace + Dropbox
  - Builder: n8n (self-hosted) + Gmail/Dropbox APIs
- [ ] Learn the minimum:
  - ingest emails
  - classify/extract key fields
  - update tracker
  - generate drafts/digests

---

## Deliverables Library (Templates to Create Once)

- [ ] Discovery Sprint 1-pager (deliverables + timeline + price)
- [ ] Pilot Proposal 1-pager (scope + success metrics + assumptions)
- [ ] Tracker schema template
- [ ] Follow-up email/text templates
- [ ] Case study format (Problem → Solution → Results)
- [ ] Loom demo checklist (2–3 min)

---

## “Andrew Follow-Up” Message Templates (for shy mode)

**Template A (simple)**
> Hey Andrew — enjoyed our chat. If you’re open to it, I’d love to do a quick 30–45 min screenshare where you walk me through one permit + subcontractor follow-up cycle. I’ll map the workflow and come back with 1–2 automation ideas. Want to pick a time this week?

**Template B (even lighter)**
> Hey Andrew — quick follow-up from our chat. If you can spare 20–30 min sometime, I’d love to hear the top 2 admin headaches in your process. I’ll sketch a small pilot idea you can react to. Any day/time that’s easy?

---

## Weekly Review (15 minutes, every Friday)

- What did I ship this week?
- Did I move Andrew forward?
- What’s the next smallest step?
- What business-readiness task did I complete (name/taxes/runway/benefits)?
- What’s one thing to delete/simplify?

---

## Appendix — Definition of Done (Pilot)

A pilot is “done” when:
- It runs on a live job for 2 weeks
- It produces consistent outputs (digests, drafts, filed docs)
- Andrew reports tangible relief (time saved, less chasing, less chaos)
- You can demo it in 2–3 minutes and explain the workflow clearly
