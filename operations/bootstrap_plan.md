# Next Chapter Bootstrap Plan  
**Version:** 0.1 (Rough Working Draft)  
**Horizon:** Now → ~4 months from now (around bonus + 52nd birthday)  

---

## 0. Purpose of This Plan

Support you in:

- Leaving MonMed around your 52nd birthday (after bonus)  
- Transitioning into AI consulting as your next chapter  
- Doing this **deliberately**, not impulsively  
- Protecting your family as much as reasonably possible (financially & emotionally)

This doc is a **living plan**, not a contract. We’ll update it as you learn.

---

## 1. High-Level Targets

### 1.1 Five-Year Target (draft)

> In 5 years, I run a small but solid AI consulting firm from South Florida, with a few contractors, several active clients, and income that comfortably supports my family and lifestyle. I work mostly from home, on problems I enjoy, with a clear sense that I own my time and direction.

We’ll refine this later with numbers (income, client count, hours/week).

### 1.2 Four-Month Target (pre-quit)

By your quit date (after bonus), you want:

1. **Legal & logistical foundation** in place (LLC, bank, basic systems).  
2. **Initial positioning & online presence** (site/landing page, clear “what I do”).  
3. **Portfolio of 2–3 concrete AI/automation examples** you can show and talk about.  
4. **Evidence of demand**:
   - A handful of real conversations with business owners.
   - Ideally 1–2 **paid or near-paid pilot projects** lined up.
5. **Financial clarity**:
   - Taxes for the windfall handled or in motion.
   - A clear runway model.
   - A decision (or plan) re: real estate / mortgage strategy.

---

## 2. Operating Constraints & Weekly Time Budget

### 2.1 Constraints

- Full-time, stressful VP job.
- Parent responsibilities + wanting to keep presence with your son.
- Mental/emotional energy is finite; this must be **sustainable enough**.

### 2.2 Proposed Weekly Time Budget (adjust as needed)

- **2 weeknights** × 1.5–2 hours = 3–4 hours  
- **1 weekend block** = 3–4 hours  
- **Total target:** **6–8 focused hours/week** on “Next Chapter” work  

> Rule of thumb: show up consistently, even if the block is short. The win is **steady progress**, not hero sprints.

---

## 3. Project Tracking Tool

You want something simple but solid.

**Suggested setup (using tools you already like):**

- **Obsidian “Next Chapter” folder / vault section**
  - `00-Plan.md` → this document (living plan).
  - `Backlog.md` → master task + idea backlog.
  - `Monthly-Log-2025-12.md`, etc. → what you did, decisions made.
- Optional: **Kanban plugin** (or simple markdown sections) for:
  - `Inbox → Next Up → Doing → Done`

You can add tasks here like:

- `[ ] File LLC in Florida`
- `[ ] Meet with CPA about windfall taxes & real estate strategy`
- `[ ] Build first demo automation for Project Helix`

We can later turn this into a more structured Kanban if you want.

---

## 4. Decisions & Research Backlog

These are **explicit decisions** you’ll need to make. Some belong in Month 1–2; others can wait.

### 4.1 Financial / Risk Decisions

- **D1:** How many months of runway do I need to feel “confident, not panicked”?  
- **D2:** Do I sell / refinance / keep my Austin properties as-is for now?  
- **D3:** Do I use any equity to:
  - Pay off or pay down my Florida homestead mortgage?
  - Build a cash runway instead?
- **D4:** Do I open a HELOC / line of credit **before** leaving MonMed?  
- **D5:** What is my **go / no-go criteria** for quitting in ~4 months?

### 4.2 Taxes & Legal

- **R1:** Research / meet with CPA about:
  - Windfall tax obligations and timing.
  - 2025 estimated taxes, especially if business income starts this year.
  - Real estate sale implications (capital gains, timing).
- **R2:** Research / file LLC (or appropriate structure):
  - Name availability.
  - State filing requirements.
- **R3:** Understand basic **self-employed tax structure**:
  - Quarterly estimated payments.
  - Business vs personal expenses.

### 4.3 Business Direction

- **D6:** Initial hypothesis niche(s) (e.g., small professional services, healthcare practices, real estate, agencies).  
- **D7:** Initial offer format:
  - e.g., “AI Workflow Audit + Prototype in 2 weeks”  
- **R4:** Short research on:
  - Tool stack: n8n/Make, OpenAI, agents, voice/avatars.
  - Similar AI consultants → what they offer, price, language.

You don’t need to decide all of this now; this list goes into your `Backlog.md`.

---

## 5. Month-by-Month Plan (Next 4 Months)

Think of these as **themes + minimum viable wins**. You can always do more.

---

### Month 1 – Foundations & Clarity (December)

**Primary goals:**
- Clarify risk tolerance and runway needs.
- Start tax + legal groundwork.
- Block the weekly schedule.

**Focus areas & tasks:**

1. **Set your quit-related guardrails**
   - [ ] Draft personal **go / no-go criteria**:
     - Minimum runway (X months of expenses).
     - Any minimum revenue or pipeline (e.g., “at least 1 paying pilot or 2 pilots scoped”).
   - [ ] Journal / reflect: “What *must* be true for me to quit in 4 months and sleep at night?”

2. **Taxes & windfall**
   - [ ] Gather docs for the windfall and 2025 tax prep.
   - [ ] Book a meeting with a **CPA** and set clear questions:
     - How much should I set aside?
     - Do I need to make estimated payments soon?
     - How does my plan to go freelance affect taxes this year / next year?
   - [ ] Create a simple **“Tax” note** in Obsidian summarizing actions & deadlines.

3. **Legal & business shell**
   - [ ] Brainstorm 3–5 potential company names.
   - [ ] Check domain availability (just quick searches).
   - [ ] Pick a working name (can change later, but pick something).
   - [ ] Start LLC filing process (or at least list next steps + costs).

4. **Time & energy**
   - [ ] Decide your **default weekly blocks** for Next Chapter work.
   - [ ] Add recurring calendar events (non-negotiable as much as possible).

---

### Month 2 – Skills, Portfolio, & Online Presence (January)

**Primary goals:**
- Have 1–2 small but *real* AI/automation projects to show.
- Have a simple landing page that says who you are and what you do.

**Focus areas & tasks:**

1. **Tool stack & learning (targeted, not random)**
   - [ ] Choose your **primary automation/orchestration tool** (e.g., n8n or Make).
   - [ ] Choose your **main LLM + integration path** (OpenAI API + whatever framework).
   - [ ] Set a learning goal: e.g., complete 2–3 small, end-to-end workflows.

2. **Portfolio projects**
   - [ ] Define 2–3 portfolio ideas:
     - Example: automated content pipeline for Project Helix.
     - Example: “AI assistant” that triages emails or messages.
   - [ ] Build at least **one complete workflow**:
     - Trigger → AI processing → output.
   - [ ] Document each:
     - Problem, what you built, value (even if hypothetical now).

3. **Simple web presence**
   - [ ] Register a domain.
   - [ ] Set up a simple landing page (could be a simple static site or even a no-code page for now) with:
     - Who you help.
     - The types of problems you solve (automation, agents, etc.).
     - A short bio (3-time VP of Eng, now focusing on AI consulting).
     - A “Book a call” button (Calendly or equivalent).

---

### Month 3 – Market Testing & First Conversations (February)

**Primary goals:**
- Talk to real business owners.
- Validate what problems they actually want solved.
- Ideally line up first pilot(s).

**Focus areas & tasks:**

1. **Warm network outreach**
   - [ ] Make a list of:
     - Friends with businesses.
     - Founders/execs you know.
   - [ ] Draft a simple outreach message:
     > “I’m starting an AI automation consulting practice and looking for a few businesses to help with a small pilot. No fluff, just practical automation to save time or reduce manual work. Interested in exploring?”

   - [ ] Reach out to 5–10 people.

2. **Discovery conversations**
   - [ ] For each conversation, capture:
     - Their business type.
     - Pain points / repetitive tasks.
     - Where they feel bottlenecked.
   - [ ] After 3–5 calls, look for patterns:
     - Similar problems?
     - Similar processes?
     - Similar “I’d pay for that” moments?

3. **Pilot offers**
   - [ ] Define a **small, tightly-scoped pilot offer**:
     - E.g., “2-week AI Workflow Audit + 1 working automation.”
   - [ ] Propose it to 1–3 contacts:
     - Be transparent that they’re early clients = better price + your full attention.
   - [ ] Aim to close **1–2 pilots**, even at modest rates.

---

### Month 4 – Pipeline & Launch Readiness (March)

**Primary goals:**
- Have at least one real client or near-client.
- Have basic operations ready to go.
- Decide whether to pull the trigger on leaving MonMed.

**Focus areas & tasks:**

1. **Operational basics**
   - [ ] Create simple **proposal template**.
   - [ ] Create simple **SOW/contract template** (can pull from a template + lawyer check later).

   - [ ] Tighten your Calendly/booking link + email signature.

2. **Clients & pipeline**
   - [ ] Aim to be *actively working with* at least 1 pilot client.
   - [ ] Have 2–3 “in play” opportunities in your pipeline.
   - [ ] Update your website with:
     - Any early case study you can share (even anonymized).

3. **Financial & emotional decision point**
   - [ ] Re-run your **runway calculation**:
     - Cash on hand.
     - Bonus.
     - Monthly burn (with vs without mortgage if relevant).
   - [ ] Revisit your **go / no-go criteria** from Month 1.
   - [ ] Make the call:
     - Quit as targeted, or  
     - Extend by a defined period (e.g., +3 months) with a clear reason (“to reach X more in pipeline / savings”).

---

## 6. Immediate Next Actions (Next 7–10 Days)

To make this plan *real*, here’s a tiny, low-friction starting list:

- [ ] Create an Obsidian note called `Next Chapter – Plan` and paste this markdown into it.  
- [ ] Create `Next Chapter – Backlog` and add:
  - “Meet with CPA re: windfall + freelance taxes”
  - “Brainstorm company names”
  - “Define weekly time blocks for Next Chapter work”
- [ ] Pick your **weekly blocks** for December and put them on your calendar.  
- [ ] Start a rough **runway note**:
  - Current savings
  - Rough monthly expenses (including mortgage)
  - Questions for CPA / financial planning

Everything else can flow from there.

---

## 7. How We’ll Use This Together

As you go:

- We’ll **update this plan** (Version 0.2, 0.3, etc.) as you:
  - Make decisions (e.g., LLC filed, name chosen).
  - Learn from conversations.
  - Clarify your financial picture.
- We can zoom in on:
  - A detailed weekly plan for December.
  - Designing your first 1–2 portfolio projects.
  - Drafting your outreach message and first offer.

---

**Working title for this doc:**  
> `Next Chapter – Bootstrap Plan (v0.1)`

You don’t have to “feel ready” to do the whole thing.  
For now, just get this into Obsidian, block your time, and pick the first 2–3 checkboxes to move this from idea → motion.

## 8. Learning & Information Sources

### 8.1 Strategy: How I’ll Learn

**Goals:**
- Understand how to **run a solo/technical consulting business** (pricing, positioning, sales, delivery).
- Understand how others are building **AI consulting / automation agencies** specifically.
- Stay up-to-date on **AI tools + agentic workflows** without drowning in noise.

**Constraints:**
- Limited time/energy → focus on a **short, curated list**, not endless content.
- Prioritize **“do this next” style material** over theory.

**Weekly learning budget (initial):**
- ~2–3 hours/week, folded into my 6–8 “Next Chapter” hours:
  - 1–2 hours: business / consulting content (books, long-form).
  - 1 hour: hands-on, “follow along and build” AI/automation tutorials.

---

> - Rule: **If you watch a video, make 3 bullet notes and 1 concrete experiment or change.**

---

### 8.5 Technical AI & Agentic Workflows

You already have strong engineering chops, so here you want **applied, practical resources**:

- Tutorials on:
  - Building AI agents that call tools / APIs.
  - Agent orchestration with automation platforms.
- Example: “AI agents made simple” or “from zero to your first agent” style content. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  

> Action:  
> - Pick one **agent tutorial** and rebuild it with your own twist (e.g., change the domain to something like practice management or real estate).  
> - Document it as a portfolio piece.

---

### 8.6 How This Fits Into the 4-Month Plan

**Month 1–2:**
- Focus your reading on:
  - 1 consulting book.
  - 1 AI-consulting-specific resource.
- Watch 1–2 key YouTube deep dives and take notes.

**Month 2–3:**
- Shift from “learning” to **“learn + build”**:
  - Every piece of content should lead to:
    - A small automation.
    - A tweak to your positioning.
    - A question to ask a potential client.

**Standing rule for yourself:**
> If I consume learning content, I will create **at least one concrete artifact** (note, template, small automation, outreach tweak) from it.

---
## 9. Portfolio Plan (Skill + Proof + Optional Passive Income)

### 9.1 Principles

- **Few, but deep:** 4–6 strong end-to-end demos > 20 half-baked toys.
- **End-to-end:** Each project should go from *input → AI → automation → output*.
- **Client-relevant:** Each maps clearly to a story you can tell a small business owner:
  > “This saves you X hours / closes Y gaps / makes Z process suck less.”

Target categories (for now):
1. **Cross-cutting email / comms automation**
2. **Real estate / property niche demo**
3. **Office admin / ops automation**
4. **Your own content & music pipelines** (YouTube avatar + Suno)

---

### 9.2 Portfolio Item 1 – Smart Email Command Center

**Category:** Cross-cutting (any knowledge worker / small business)  
**Goal:** Show you can tame email chaos and reduce manual triage/replies.

**User story (how you’d explain it):**  
> “You wake up to 150 emails. Instead of slogging through all of them, this system:
> - categorizes them by priority and topic,
> - gives you a daily digest,
> - drafts replies for common patterns.”

**Features (v1):**
- Pull emails from a mailbox (e.g., a test Gmail account).
- Classify into buckets (e.g., “Leads”, “Clients”, “Internal”, “Newsletters”).
- Generate:
  - A **daily summary email** (“here’s what matters today”).
  - Suggested replies for selected threads.

**Tech ideas:**
- n8n/Make (trigger: new email)  
- LLM for classification + summarization + draft responses  
- Store structured data in a spreadsheet / simple DB

**How you’ll show it off:**
- Short Loom-style walkthrough (“this is what happens when an email comes in”).
- Before/after story: “Here’s what my inbox looked like; here’s how this changes the workflow.”

---

### 9.3 Portfolio Item 2 – Real Estate Client Update & Newsletter Engine

**Category:** Real estate niche  
**Goal:** Show specialized understanding of a realtor’s world + automation.

**User story:**  
> “You’re a realtor with 30 active clients. Every week you manually:
> - check Zillow/MLS for changes,
> - gather feedback,
> - write update emails or newsletters.
> This system auto-creates those updates for you to review & send.”

**Features (v1):**
- Input: spreadsheet or simple DB of:
  - Client name, property address, stage, notes/feedback.

  - Example: scrape or manually input property status / price / days-on-market.
- Generate:
  - **Per-client update email** (status + feedback + next steps).
  - **Optional weekly “market update” newsletter** for a list of clients.

**Tech ideas:**
- n8n/Make scenario:
  - On schedule → read sheet → enrich data (APIs or mock data) → call LLM to generate emails → write to doc or draft emails.
- Simple front-end: Not needed initially; backend workflow is enough.

**How you’ll show it off:**
- Anonymized example client spreadsheet → generated emails.
- Pitch story:  
  > “You could go from 3 hours of manual updates to 10 minutes of review & send.”

**Next step (optional):**
- Ask your realtor friend if you can tailor it to their exact process as a “beta” demo.

---

### 9.4 Portfolio Item 3 – Office Admin: Meeting → Tasks Pipeline

**Category:** Pure office administration  
**Goal:** Show you can turn messy meetings into structured action.

**User story:**  
> “You end every week with a pile of meeting notes and no clear list of who owns what. This system:
> - ingests meeting transcript/notes,
> - summarizes decisions,
> - extracts tasks with owners and due dates,
> - pushes them into your task system (or a simple sheet).”

**Features (v1):**

---

### 9.5 Portfolio Item 4 – Admin: Billing & Follow-Up Assistant (Optional, but strong)

**Category:** Office admin / back office ops  
**Goal:** Show you can streamline AP/AR, a pain point for many small businesses.

**User story:**  
> “You send invoices and then… forget to follow up. This system:
> - tracks outstanding invoices,
> - gently nudges clients when they’re late,
> - updates a simple dashboard of ‘who owes what’.”

**Features (v1):**
- Input: simple invoice log (sheet with amount, due date, status, email).
- Weekly:
  - Identify overdue invoices.
  - Draft polite follow-up emails.

---

### 9.6 Portfolio Item 5 – Automated YouTube Avatar Channel

**Category:** Your own content + long-term passive income experiment  
**Goal:** Show you can orchestrate a multi-step AI content pipeline.

**User story (for prospects):**  
> “Imagine you want a weekly video tip for your clients. This pipeline:
> - generates scripts,
> - turns them into avatar videos,
> - uploads and optimizes them,
> with minimal manual effort.”

**Pipeline (v1):**
1. Idea list (themes you care about: AI, productivity, tech leadership).
2. Script generator:
   - Use prompts/templates to turn ideas into scripts.
3. Avatar & voice:
   - Use an avatar tool to generate video from script.
4. Publishing helper:
   - LLM generates title, description, tags.
   - Optional: simple script to prepare upload / thumbnails.

**How you’ll show it off:**
- Show the pipeline as a diagram.
- Show 2–3 actual videos produced.
- Talk through which steps are automated vs manual and how it could be adapted for a business’s content.

---

### 9.7 Portfolio Item 6 – Suno Music Pipeline (AI Music Catalog)

**Category:** Your own creative project + pipeline demo  
**Goal:** Show you can integrate external AI tools into a repeatable, semi-automated content workflow.

**User story (for prospects):**  
> “The tech here is similar to how we’d automate any repetitive creative task: prompts in, assets out, packaged for distribution.”

**Pipeline (v1):**
1. Theme/genre selection.
2. Prompt generator:
   - Small script that creates structured prompts for Suno.
3. Suno song generation (manual call at first, then semi-automated if possible).
4. Post-processing:
   - LLM to write track descriptions, social blurbs, titles.
5. Distribution helper:
   - Optional: prepare upload metadata for YouTube/Spotify/etc.

**How you’ll show it off:**
- Diagram or README of the pipeline.
- 3–5 tracks available online.
- Emphasis on *pipeline design*, not just “I clicked ‘generate’ in Suno.”

---

### 9.8 Integration With Discovery Calls

You already noted this, but make it explicit:

- `[ ] Schedule 3–5 discovery calls with people I know (realtor, small business owners, etc.)`
- Goal of calls:
  - Validate if these portfolio items map to **real pain**.
  - Ask: “What would you actually pay for?” / “What feels most painful/time-consuming?”

Use what you learn to:
- Adjust features.
- Decide which projects to polish more.
- Maybe add a new portfolio item that comes straight from a real complaint.

---

### 9.9 Sequence (So You Don’t Get Overwhelmed)

Suggested order:

1. **Email Command Center** – fastest win, most universal.
2. **Real Estate Client Update Engine** – niche-specific and leverages your existing contact.
3. **Meeting → Tasks Pipeline** – great for almost any knowledge business.
4. **YouTube Avatar Channel** – build slowly alongside the others.
5. **Suno Music Pipeline** – treat as a creative “lab” when you have some headroom.
6. **Billing & Follow-Up Assistant** – optional but powerful if time allows.

Each time you finish one:
- Make a short demo.
- Write a 1-page “case study” (Problem → Solution → Outcome / Potential Impact).
- Add it to your website and your mental “stories” for sales conversations.
